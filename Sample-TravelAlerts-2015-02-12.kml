      <description>The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens to screening procedures, travel restrictions, and reduced aviation transportation options in response to the outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.&lt;p&gt;This Travel Alert will expire on June 2, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to an outbreak of EVD in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone &amp;nbsp;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued Level 3 Travel Warnings advising against non-essential travel to these countries &amp;nbsp;and to practice enhanced precautions for avoidance of contact with ill individuals. The Bureau of Consular Affairs&amp;#8217; website prominently features an &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Ebola.html"&gt;Ebola Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt; and links to the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC Health&lt;/a&gt; Travel Warnings, Travel Alert, and general guidance about Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC have also published and provided&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/monitoring-and-movement-of-persons-with-exposure.html" target="_blank"&gt;interim guidance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to public health authorities, airlines, and other partners in West Africa for evaluating risk of exposure of persons coming from countries affected by EVD.&amp;nbsp; Travelers should consult the &lt;a href="http://www.dhs.gov/news/2014/10/08/enhanced-ebola-screening-start-five-us-airports-all-people-entering-us-ebola" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; website for the most up-to-date information regarding enhanced screening procedures at five U.S. airports (Newark, New York JFK, O&amp;#8217;Hare, Atlanta, and Dulles) for all people entering the United States from or who have traveled through the Ebola-affected countries.&amp;nbsp; Travelers who exhibit symptoms indicative of possible Ebola infection may be prevented from boarding and restricted from traveling for the 21-day period.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, CDC&amp;#8217;s guidelines outline the minimum recommended procedures, and state and local governments have the power to implement more stringent procedures. Please note neither&amp;nbsp;the Department of State&amp;#8217;s Bureau of Consular Affairs nor the U.S. Embassy have authority over quarantine issues and cannot prevent a U.S. citizen from being quarantined should local health authorities overseas, or in the United States, require it.&amp;nbsp; For questions about quarantine, please visit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/"&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that addresses quarantine and isolation issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evacuation from Ebola-affected countries is very difficult, even for non-Ebola illnesses.&amp;nbsp; The cost for a medical evacuation flight can exceed $150,000.&amp;nbsp; We encourage U.S. citizens travelling to Ebola-affected countries to purchase travel insurance and ensure this insurance includes medical evacuation for EVD.&amp;nbsp; Policy holders should confirm the availability of medical care and evacuation services at their travel destinations prior to travel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some local, regional, and international air carriers have curtailed or temporarily suspended service to or from Ebola-affected countries.&amp;nbsp; U.S. citizens planning travel to or from these countries, in accordance with the CDC Health Travel Warnings and Health Travel Alert, should contact their airline to verify seat availability, confirm departure schedules, inquire about screening procedures, and be aware of other airline options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department is aware that some countries have put in place procedures relating to the travel of individuals from or who have traveled through the affected countries, including complete travel bans.&amp;nbsp; Changes to existing procedures may occur with little or no notice.&amp;nbsp; Please consult your airline or the embassy of your destination country for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens traveling or residing abroad enroll in the Department of State&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step"&gt;Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&lt;/a&gt;. STEP enrollment allows you to receive the Department&amp;#8217;s safety and security updates, and makes it easier for the nearest U.S. embassy or U.S. consulate to contact you in an emergency.&amp;nbsp; If you do not have Internet access, enroll directly with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly monitor the &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/"&gt;State Department&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;where you can find current Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and the Worldwide Caution, and read the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/russia.html"&gt;Country Specific Information&lt;/a&gt; for your destination countries.&amp;nbsp; For additional information, refer to&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Traveler's Checklist&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english.html"&gt;State Department's website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Current information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free from within the United States and Canada, or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries.&amp;nbsp; These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).&amp;nbsp; Follow us on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/travelgov" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to the South Pacific region about the ongoing threat of tropical cyclones affecting the area.&lt;p&gt;While tropical cyclones in the South Pacific may occur throughout the year, the current South Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season begins on November 1, 2014, and ends April 30, 2015.&amp;nbsp; U.S. citizens living in or traveling to the region should monitor local weather reports and take other appropriate action as needed.&amp;nbsp; This Travel Alert expires on April 30, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends that people living or traveling in regions prone to tropical storms and tropical cyclones be prepared.&amp;nbsp; For further information about tropical cyclone preparedness, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/hurricane/resources/TropicalCyclones11.pdf"&gt;NOAA's Tropical Cyclones Preparedness Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For further information on tropical cyclone warnings in the South Pacific region, please consult the &lt;a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/"&gt;Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/cphc/"&gt;National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.met.gov.fj/"&gt;Fiji's regional meteorological center&lt;/a&gt; responsible for tropical cyclone warnings in the South Pacific region, or the &lt;a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/"&gt;Government of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During and after some previous storms, U.S. citizens traveling abroad encountered dangerous and often uncomfortable conditions that lasted for several days while they awaited transportation to the United States.&amp;nbsp; In the past, many U.S. citizens were forced to delay travel (including return travel to the United States) due to infrastructure damage to airports and limited flight availability.&amp;nbsp; Roads were also washed out or obstructed by debris, adversely affecting access to airports and land routes out of affected areas.&amp;nbsp; Reports of looting and sporadic violence in the aftermath of natural disasters have occurred.&amp;nbsp; Security personnel may not always be readily available to assist.&amp;nbsp; In the event of a cyclone, you should be aware that you may not be able to depart the area for 24-48 hours or longer, particularly if you are residing in or visiting a South Pacific Island country where air service is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also may encounter uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous conditions after storms pass.&amp;nbsp; In many places, tropical cyclones are often accompanied by damaging high tides and flooding.&amp;nbsp; If you are living near or staying close to the ocean or other bodies of water, you may be at higher risk.&amp;nbsp; Landslides and mudslides are also a serious concern during heavy rains.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to check with local authorities for safety and security updates.&amp;nbsp; Weather conditions or damage to infrastructure may delay or prevent needed assistance from U.S. embassy and host country security personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are living in or traveling to storm-prone regions overseas during the cyclone season, we recommend you consider obtaining travel insurance to cover unexpected expenses during an emergency, as well as medical insurance with provision for emergency medical evacuations to the United States.&amp;nbsp; In some instances, commercial medical evacuations can cost 100,000 USD or more and may not be covered by your regular medical insurance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the damage in the aftermath of a storm requires evacuation, the Department of State will work with commercial airlines to ensure that U.S. citizens may depart as safely and efficiently as possible.&amp;nbsp; Commercial airlines are the Department&amp;#8217;s primary source of transportation in an evacuation; other means of transport are utilized only as a last resort, are often more expensive, and will provide you with fewer destination options.&amp;nbsp; U.S. law requires that any evacuation costs are your responsibility.&amp;nbsp; For those in financial need, the U.S. Department of State has the authority to provide crisis evacuation and repatriation loans.&amp;nbsp; For more information, please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies.html"&gt;Emergencies Abroad&lt;/a&gt; page on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in or are traveling to storm-prone regions, prepare for hurricanes and tropical storms by organizing a kit in a waterproof container that includes a supply of bottled water, non-perishable food items, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio, any medications taken regularly, and vital documents (especially your passport and other identification).&amp;nbsp; Emergency shelters often provide only very basic resources and may have limited medical and food supplies.&amp;nbsp; NOAA and the &lt;a href="http://www.fema.gov/"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)&lt;/a&gt; have additional tips on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor local radio, local media, and the National Weather Service to be aware of weather developments.&amp;nbsp; Minor tropical cyclones can develop into hurricanes very quickly, limiting the time available for a safe evacuation.&amp;nbsp; Inform family and friends of your whereabouts and remain in close contact with your tour operator, hotel staff, transportation providers (airlines, cruise lines, etc.), and local officials for evacuation instructions during a weather emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage that U.S. citizens traveling abroad enroll in the Department of State&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step/"&gt;Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; STEP enrollment gives you the latest security updates, and makes it easier for the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to contact you in an emergency.&amp;nbsp; If you don&amp;#8217;t have Internet access, enroll directly with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly monitor the State Department's website, where you can find current &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html"&gt;Travel Warnings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html"&gt;Travel Alerts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html"&gt;the Worldwide Caution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For additional information, refer to the &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/checklist.html"&gt;Traveler's Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;on the &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/"&gt;State Department&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will find additional information on cyclones and storm preparedness on the Bureau of Consular Affairs' &lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/hurricane-and-typhoon-season-travel-alert.html"&gt;Hurricane Season &amp;#8211; Know Before You Go website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Contact the U.S. embassy or consulate for up-to-date information on travel restrictions.&amp;nbsp; You can also call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and &lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/oeo/iptu/treaties/03-02-77canada-us.pdf"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries.&amp;nbsp; These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).&amp;nbsp; Follow us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
